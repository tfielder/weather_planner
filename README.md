## <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction
  Many of us plan our activities and what we'll wear based on the weather, so why not have all of these in one place? Weatherwise is a basic app that integrates the weather, apparel recommendations based on the weather, and daily events all in one place.

  Visit the app here: https://whetherwise.herokuapp.com/

  This app also makes use of the weather planner backend api.
  The backend api repo can be found here: https://github.com/tfielder/api_weather_planner
  And the backend live api can be found here: https://weather-planner-api.herokuapp.com/
